# Up Or Down? (Under Development)

![SS1](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1282JDPkcAcq2g_5vLzTZN1DnPYO7Tu12)

Just a 2D platformer game I'm currently working on using Godot (Game Engine) and GDscript (language). [NO MORE INFO FOR NOW]

## Credits for resourses that aren't mine:
- The Sprites and Tileset used: [Kenney's Scribble Platformer](https://www.kenney.nl/assets/scribble-platformer) (I modified a few things to suit the game theme as it's allowed as the asset pack's license)

## Godot Engine plugins being used for this project:
- [Godot-Next](https://github.com/godot-extended-libraries/godot-next)
- [TODO Manager](https://github.com/OrigamiDev-Pete/TODO_Manager) (Has nothing to do with the actual game, I'm just crediting altought nobody asked)
